<!-- Hey there! Welcome to the first lesson of your TinkerWeb journey. -->

<!--
	If you haven't guessed already, everything enclosed between the combination of angular brackets, hyphens
	and an exclamation mark (seen in the lines above and below this sentence) are comments.
-->

<!-- Comments are not rendered out in the webpage when you view it in a browser. So you can use as many or as little
	 comments as you like in a file. It is generally used to document the code, so anyone trying to figure out
     how a site works will have an easier time doing that. Or you could use it to make notes in different sections
	 of a complex webpage so that you can easy recall what a particular section does when you come back to it at 
	 a later time. -->


<!-- An element is a part of a webpage. In HTML, tags are used to create elements. 
	The name of an HTML element is the name used in angle brackets (for example, <title>).
	HTML tags mostly occur in pairs (we'll look at exceptions later in the course), one to mark the beginning of
	the element and another to mark the end. The 'closing' tags are similar to the 'opening' tags, except that a 
	forward slash is prepended to the tag name. --> 


<html lang="en">
	
	<!-- The <html> element represents the 'root' (top-level element) of an HTML document. 
		All other elements must be descendants of this element. -->

	<!-- The opening tags of elements can have attributes that specifies its behavior or provides metadata.
		Attributes have the form name="value". -->	

	<head>	

		<!-- The <head> element contains metadata about the web page, like its title, scripts, and style sheets. -->

  		<meta charset="utf-8">
 	 	<title>Intro to HTML5 </title>
		<!-- The text enclosed with the 'title' tags is displayed in the title bar of the browser while viewing the page. -->
	
	</head>

	<body> <!-- This is where the actual content displayed to users is defined. -->

		<!-- you can't see me in a browser ;-) -->
  		Welcome to the very first session of Web Frontend development conducted by Tinkerhub GECT.
